# PM Agent Contradiction Analysis

**Date:** 2025-10-22  
**Issue:** Task-1.1 failure due to contradictory requirements  
**Root Cause:** PM agent created impossible success criteria  

---

## 🔍 PROBLEM SUMMARY

The PM agent created task-1.1 with **fundamentally contradictory requirements**:

1. **Prompt (line 132):** "List all files and directories in the current directory using the `list_dir` tool."
2. **Success Criteria (line 147):** "Output matches the result of `ls -la`"
3. **Reality:** `list_dir` tool **cannot** match `ls -la` output (no hidden file support)

**Result:** Worker agent executed correctly but failed QC because the task requirements were impossible.

---

## 📊 EXECUTION EVIDENCE

### Task-1.1 Execution Results

**Worker Output:**
```json
{
  "list_dir_output": ["bin/", "build/", "coverage/", ...],
  "ls_la_output": "total 824\ndrwxrwxr-x@ 44 c815719 staff 1408 Oct 22 07:40 .\n...\ndrwxr-xr-x@ 4 c815719 staff 128 Oct 20 06:41 .agents\n...",
  "notes": "The `list_dir` tool does NOT include hidden files (dotfiles), as shown by comparison with the authoritative `ls -la` output."
}
```

**QC Feedback (Score: 50/100):**
- ❌ Issue 1: Hidden files missing from `list_dir` output
- ❌ Issue 2: Output doesn't match `ls -la` results
- ❌ Issue 3: Worker used wrong tool to meet requirements

**Required Fixes:**
1. Use `run_terminal_cmd('ls -la')` instead of `list_dir`
2. Store `ls -la` output as authoritative listing
3. Document that `list_dir` doesn't include hidden files

### Analysis

**Worker Agent:** ✅ Performed correctly
- Followed explicit instruction to use `list_dir`
- Ran `ls -la` for cross-verification
- **Explicitly documented the tool limitation**

**QC Agent:** ✅ Performed correctly
- Identified the discrepancy
- Provided root cause analysis
- Recommended the correct fix

**PM Agent:** ❌ Created impossible requirements
- Mandated use of `list_dir` tool
- Required output to match `ls -la`
- Did not account for tool limitations

---

## 🔎 ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS

### 1. Missing Tool Capability Documentation

**Current State:**
- PM preamble does NOT document tool limitations
- No reference guide for tool capabilities
- PM agent must infer tool behavior from general knowledge

**Evidence from PM Preamble:**
```markdown
## 📚 KNOWLEDGE ACCESS MODE
**Mode:** Hybrid (Context + General Knowledge)

**Required Context Gathering:**
1. read_file('package.json') - Check dependencies and scripts
2. read_file('README.md') - Understand project purpose
3. list_dir('.') - Survey project structure
4. grep('test', '.', type: 'js') - Find testing patterns
5. read_file('[relevant-config]') - Check configuration
```

**Problem:** No step to "verify tool capabilities and limitations"

### 2. No Anti-Pattern for Tool Mismatches

**Current Anti-Patterns (v2.0):**
1. Vague task descriptions
2. Missing dependencies
3. Unmeasurable success criteria
4. Generic role descriptions
5. No tool call estimates
6. Skipping task-0
7. Monolithic tasks
8. Code generation tasks
9. Duplicate dependencies
10. Self-reference dependencies
11. No dependencies when needed

**Missing:** Anti-pattern for "Contradictory Tool Requirements"

### 3. Task-0 Template Doesn't Validate Tool Capabilities

**Current Task-0 Template (lines 260-321):**
```markdown
**Required Validations:**

1. **Tool Availability:**
   - Execute: `run_terminal_cmd('which node')`
   - Execute: `run_terminal_cmd('which npm')`
   - Expected: Paths to executables

2. **Dependencies:**
   - Execute: `run_terminal_cmd('npm list --depth=0')`
   - Expected: All package.json dependencies listed

3. **Build System:**
   - Execute: `run_terminal_cmd('npm run build')`
   - Expected: Exit code 0, no errors

4. **Configuration Files:**
   - Execute: `read_file('package.json')`
   - Execute: `read_file('[required-config-file]')`
   - Expected: Files exist with valid content
```

**Problem:** Validates system tools, but not MCP tool capabilities (e.g., "does `list_dir` support hidden files?")

### 4. Success Criteria Guidelines Don't Address Tool Limitations

**Current Guidelines (lines 186-217):**
```markdown
**Success Criteria Pattern:**
- [ ] Specific: [Exact file, exact command, exact output]
- [ ] Measurable: [Number, percentage, boolean]
- [ ] Achievable: [Within worker's capabilities]
- [ ] Relevant: [Directly tied to requirement]
- [ ] Testable: [Can be verified with tool command]
```

**Problem:** "Achievable" is mentioned but not enforced. No guidance on "verify tool can actually produce required output."

## 🛠️ PROPOSED SOLUTIONS

### Solution 1: Add Tool Capability Reference to PM Preamble

**Location:** `docs/agents/v2/01-pm-preamble.md` (after line 471)

**New Section:**
```markdown
## 🔧 TOOL CAPABILITIES & LIMITATIONS

**CRITICAL:** Before creating tasks, understand what each tool CAN and CANNOT do.

### Filesystem Tools

**`list_dir(path)`**
- ✅ Lists files and directories in a path
- ✅ Returns structured array of names
- ❌ Does NOT include hidden files (dotfiles like `.git`, `.env`)
- ❌ Does NOT include file metadata (permissions, size, dates)
- **Use When:** You need a simple list of visible files
- **Don't Use When:** You need hidden files or file metadata

**`run_terminal_cmd('ls -la')`**
- ✅ Lists ALL files including hidden files
- ✅ Includes full metadata (permissions, size, owner, dates)
- ✅ Supports all `ls` flags and options
- ❌ Returns unstructured string output
- **Use When:** You need complete directory listing with metadata
- **Don't Use When:** You need structured/parseable output

**`read_file(path)`**
- ✅ Reads file contents
- ✅ Supports text files of any size
- ❌ Does NOT list directory contents
- ❌ Does NOT support binary files
- **Use When:** You need file contents
- **Don't Use When:** You need directory listing

### Graph Tools

**`graph_search_nodes(query, options)`**
- ✅ Full-text search across all node properties
- ✅ Case-insensitive search with `toLower()`
- ✅ Filter by node types
- ❌ Requires exact substring match (CONTAINS operator)
- ❌ Does NOT support fuzzy matching or word boundaries
- **Use When:** You know exact keywords or phrases
- **Don't Use When:** You need fuzzy search or multi-word queries

### Terminal Tools

**`run_terminal_cmd(command)`**
- ✅ Executes any shell command
- ✅ Returns stdout, stderr, exit code
- ✅ Supports pipes, redirects, and complex commands
- ❌ Requires command to be installed on system
- ❌ May have different behavior across OS (Linux vs macOS vs Windows)
- **Use When:** You need system-level operations
- **Don't Use When:** Structured MCP tools exist for the task

### Rule: Verify Tool Compatibility

**Before creating success criteria:**
1. Identify which tool the prompt mandates
2. Identify what the success criteria requires
3. Verify the tool can actually produce that output
4. If mismatch: Either change the tool OR change the criteria

**Example:**
```markdown
❌ BAD:
**Prompt:** Use `list_dir` to list files
**Success Criteria:** Output matches `ls -la` results
**Problem:** `list_dir` cannot match `ls -la` (no hidden files)

✅ GOOD Option 1 (Change Tool):
**Prompt:** Use `run_terminal_cmd('ls -la')` to list files
**Success Criteria:** Output includes all files including hidden files

✅ GOOD Option 2 (Change Criteria):
**Prompt:** Use `list_dir` to list files
**Success Criteria:** Output includes all visible files (hidden files excluded)
```
```

### Solution 2: Add Anti-Pattern 12 - Contradictory Tool Requirements

**Location:** `docs/agents/v2/01-pm-preamble.md` (after line 565)

**New Anti-Pattern:**
```markdown
### Anti-Pattern 12: Contradictory Tool Requirements ⚠️ CRITICAL
```markdown
❌ BAD:
**Prompt:** Use `list_dir` to list all files
**Success Criteria:** Output matches `ls -la` results
**Problem:** `list_dir` cannot include hidden files, so it can never match `ls -la`

✅ GOOD:
**Prompt:** Use `run_terminal_cmd('ls -la')` to list all files including hidden files
**Success Criteria:** Output includes hidden files (files starting with '.')

OR

**Prompt:** Use `list_dir` to list visible files
**Success Criteria:** Output includes all non-hidden files
**Context:** Hidden files are excluded by design (use `ls -la` for complete listing)
```

**Rule:** The tool specified in the prompt MUST be capable of satisfying the success criteria. Verify tool capabilities before creating tasks.
```
```

### Solution 3: Enhance Task-0 Template with Tool Capability Validation

**Location:** `docs/agents/v2/01-pm-preamble.md` (lines 278-297)

**Enhanced Task-0 Template:**
```markdown
**Required Validations:**

1. **Tool Availability:**
   - Execute: `run_terminal_cmd('which [required-tool]')`
   - Expected: Paths to executables

2. **MCP Tool Capabilities:** ⭐ NEW
   - Execute: `list_dir('.')`
   - Execute: `run_terminal_cmd('ls -la')`
   - Compare: Document differences (hidden files, metadata)
   - Expected: Understand tool limitations for task planning

3. **Dependencies:**
   - Execute: `run_terminal_cmd('npm list --depth=0')`
   - Expected: All package.json dependencies listed

4. **Build System:**
   - Execute: `run_terminal_cmd('npm run build')`
   - Expected: Exit code 0, no errors

5. **Configuration Files:**
   - Execute: `read_file('package.json')`
   - Execute: `read_file('[required-config-file]')`
   - Expected: Files exist with valid content
```

### Solution 4: Add Verification Step to Final Checklist

**Location:** `docs/agents/v2/01-pm-preamble.md` (line 488, before "If ANY checkbox is unchecked")

**New Checklist Item:**
```markdown
- [ ] Did you verify tool capabilities match success criteria (no contradictions)?
```

### Solution 5: Add Tool Compatibility Check to STEP 5 (Success Criteria)

**Location:** `docs/agents/v2/01-pm-preamble.md` (after line 217)

**New Subsection:**
```markdown
### Tool Compatibility Verification

**CRITICAL:** Before finalizing success criteria, verify the specified tool can satisfy them.

**Verification Process:**
1. Identify tool mandated in prompt: `[tool_name]`
2. Identify required output in success criteria: `[expected_output]`
3. Check tool capabilities reference (see Tool Capabilities section)
4. Verify: Can `[tool_name]` produce `[expected_output]`?
5. If NO: Either change tool OR change criteria

**Example:**
```markdown
Task Prompt: "Use list_dir to list all files"
Success Criteria: "Output matches ls -la results"

Verification:
1. Tool: list_dir
2. Expected: matches ls -la (includes hidden files)
3. Capability: list_dir does NOT support hidden files
4. Result: ❌ CONTRADICTION DETECTED

Fix Option 1 (Change Tool):
Task Prompt: "Use run_terminal_cmd('ls -la') to list all files"
Success Criteria: "Output includes all files including hidden files"

Fix Option 2 (Change Criteria):
Task Prompt: "Use list_dir to list all files"
Success Criteria: "Output includes all visible files (hidden files excluded)"
Context: "Note: list_dir does not include hidden files by design"
```
```

## 📈 IMPACT ASSESSMENT

### Current Failure Pattern

**Execution 1 (from execution-report.md):**
- Task-0: ✅ Success (100 score)
- Task-0 (duplicate): ✅ Success (100 score)
- Task-1.1: ❌ Failure (50 score) - Tool limitation

**Execution 2 (latest):**
- Task-0: ✅ Success (100 score)
- Task-0 (duplicate): ✅ Success (100 score)
- Task-1.1: ❌ Failure (50 score) - Same tool limitation

**Pattern:** 100% failure rate on task-1.1 due to PM planning error, not worker or QC error.

### Expected Impact of Solutions

**With Tool Capability Reference:**
- PM agent would know `list_dir` doesn't support hidden files
- Would either mandate `ls -la` OR adjust success criteria
- Estimated failure reduction: 80-90%

**With Anti-Pattern 12:**
- PM agent would recognize contradiction pattern
- Would verify tool-criteria compatibility
- Estimated failure reduction: 70-80%

**With Enhanced Task-0:**
- Workers would document tool limitations upfront
- PM agent would have tool capability data for planning
- Estimated failure reduction: 60-70%

**Combined Impact:**
- Estimated failure reduction: 95%+
- Remaining 5%: Novel tool limitations not yet documented

## 🔬 LESSONS LEARNED

### What Worked

1. ✅ **Worker agents correctly identified tool limitations**
   - Documented in output notes
   - Provided comparison between tools
   - Recommended correct approach

2. ✅ **QC agents correctly identified contradictions**
   - Root cause analysis was accurate
   - Required fixes were specific and actionable
   - Feedback was clear and directive

3. ✅ **Task-0 environment validation succeeded**
   - System-level validation worked perfectly
   - Tool availability checks passed
   - Foundation was solid

### What Didn't Work

1. ❌ **PM agent created impossible requirements**
   - No awareness of tool limitations
   - No verification of tool-criteria compatibility
   - Assumed tools were interchangeable

2. ❌ **No tool capability reference available**
   - PM agent had to infer from general knowledge
   - No authoritative source for tool limitations
   - Led to incorrect assumptions

3. ❌ **No anti-pattern for contradictory requirements**
   - PM preamble didn't warn against this
   - No checklist item to catch it
   - Pattern repeated across multiple executions

### Key Insight

**The failure was NOT in execution, but in planning.**

- Workers executed correctly
