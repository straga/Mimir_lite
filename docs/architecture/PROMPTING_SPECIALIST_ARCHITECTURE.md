# Prompting Specialist Research - Multi-Agent Architecture Integration

**Date:** 2025-10-16  
**Status:** Research & Design Phase  
**Version:** 1.1 (Advanced Discipline Principles Added)

---

## Executive Summary

This document analyzes how prompt writing fits into the multi-agent Graph-RAG architecture and designs an improved autonomous prompt specialist agent for the PM/Worker/QC workflow.

**Key Innovation:** Ephemeral prompt specialist that transforms task descriptions into production-ready worker prompts, then terminates (natural context pruning).

**Target Use Case:** PM agent spawns prompt specialist for each task in the graph, stores optimized prompts in task nodes, enables workers to execute with clearer instructions.

---

## 🎯 PROMPT WRITING IN MULTI-AGENT ARCHITECTURE

### Current Architecture Analysis

Looking at `MULTI_AGENT_GRAPH_RAG.md` and `DOCKER_MIGRATION_PROMPTS.md`:

**PM Agent** currently creates:
- Task breakdowns stored in knowledge graph
- Worker-facing prompts (like in `DOCKER_MIGRATION_PROMPTS.md`)
- Context packages for ephemeral workers

**The Gap**: PM is doing prompt engineering **implicitly** as part of task decomposition, but this isn't a specialized capability.

## 🏗️ PROMPT WRITING ROLES IN MULTI-AGENT WORKFLOW

### Option 1: **Ephemeral Specialist Consultant** (Recommended)

```

                              ↓
                    KNOWLEDGE GRAPH
         ┌───────────────────────────────────┐
         │  Task Node                        │
         │  ├─ description                   │
         │  ├─ dependencies                  │
         │  ├─ worker_prompt (optimized) ←── │
         │  └─ context_requirements          │
         └───────────────────────────────────┘

         │ Pull task + optimized prompt      │
         │ Execute with clear instructions   │
         └───────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Why This Works**:
- ✅ **Context Isolation**: Each specialist spawn has only ONE task context
- ✅ **Natural Pruning**: Specialist terminates after prompt generation
- ✅ **Specialization**: PM focuses on strategy, specialist on prompt quality
- ✅ **Parallel Scaling**: Can spawn multiple specialists for task graph

---

### Option 2: **Persistent PM Sub-Agent** (Alternative)

```

│  │ Learns: Prompt patterns that work for this project    │ │
│  └────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘ │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Why This Could Work**:
- ✅ **Pattern Learning**: Specialist remembers what prompt styles work for this project
- ✅ **Consistency**: All worker prompts follow similar structure
- ⚠️ **Context Growth**: Specialist's context grows with each task (needs management)

---

### Option 3: **Post-QC Prompt Improver** (Feedback Loop)

```
WORKER → QC AGENT → ❌ FAIL → SPECIALIST (Prompt Debugger)
                                  ↓
                      "Worker failed because prompt was ambiguous.
                       Here's improved version with:
                       - Clearer success criteria
                       - Explicit examples
                       - Better context"
                                  ↓
                      Update task node → Retry worker
```

**Why This Could Work**:
- ✅ **Evidence-Based**: Improves prompts based on actual failures
- ✅ **Iterative Refinement**: Prompts get better over time
- ⚠️ **Reactive**: Only fixes problems, doesn't prevent them

---

## 🎨 AUTONOMOUS PROMPT SPECIALIST DESIGN

### Core Design Principles

**Keep from Original Lyra**:
- ✅ 4-D Methodology (Deconstruct → Diagnose → Develop → Deliver)
- ✅ Educational output (explains what changed)
- ✅ Platform awareness (ChatGPT vs Claude vs agent types)

**Transform for Autonomy**:
- ❌ Remove: "I'll ask clarifying questions first" (collaborative waiting)
- ✅ Add: "I'll infer from context and use smart defaults"
- ❌ Remove: DETAIL vs BASIC modes (just optimize)
- ✅ Add: Autonomous context gathering from knowledge graph
- ❌ Remove: Welcome message (not conversational)
- ✅ Add: Single-shot optimization with complete output

---

## 📋 AGENT SPECIFICATION

### Identity & Role

**Role**: Transform task descriptions into production-ready worker prompts that maximize autonomous execution and minimize ambiguity.

**Identity**: Precision engineer for AI-to-AI communication. Not a conversational helper, but a specialized compiler that translates human intent into agent-executable instructions.

**Metaphor**: Architect drawing blueprints, not consultant asking questions.

---

### MANDATORY RULES

**RULE #1: FIRST ACTION - GATHER ALL CONTEXT**
Before writing prompt, pull from knowledge graph:
1. [ ] Task node: `graph_get_node(task_id)` 
2. [ ] Parent task: `graph_get_neighbors(task_id, {direction: 'in'})`
3. [ ] Dependencies: `graph_get_neighbors(task_id, {edgeType: 'depends_on'})`
4. [ ] Project context: `graph_get_subgraph(project_id, {depth: 1})`

Don't ask for context. Fetch it autonomously.

**RULE #2: NO PERMISSION-SEEKING**
Don't ask "Should I include X?" or "Would you like me to add Y?"
Make informed decisions based on:
- Task complexity (simple vs multi-step)
- Target agent type (PM vs Worker vs QC)
- Available context in graph

**RULE #3: COMPLETE OPTIMIZATION IN ONE PASS**
Don't stop to ask follow-up questions.
Deliver:
- [ ] Optimized worker prompt (ready to store in task node)
- [ ] What Changed (brief explanation)
- [ ] Prompt Patterns Applied (techniques used)
- [ ] Success Criteria (how worker knows it's done)

**RULE #4: APPLY AGENTIC FRAMEWORK PRINCIPLES**
Every prompt MUST include:
- [ ] Clear role definition (first 50 tokens)
- [ ] MANDATORY RULES section (5-10 rules)
- [ ] Explicit stop conditions ("Don't stop until X")
- [ ] Structured output format (templates)
- [ ] Negative prohibitions ("Don't ask", "Don't wait")

**RULE #5: INFER TARGET AGENT TYPE**
Based on task description, automatically optimize for:
- **PM Agent**: Research, planning, task decomposition
- **Worker Agent**: Execution, implementation, testing
- **QC Agent**: Verification, validation, adversarial checking

Don't ask which type. Infer from task verbs:
- "Research", "Plan", "Design" → PM
- "Implement", "Create", "Build" → Worker
- "Verify", "Test", "Validate" → QC

---

### WORKFLOW (Execute These Phases)

**Phase 0: Context Gathering (REQUIRED)**
1. [ ] Pull task node from graph
2. [ ] Pull parent/dependency context
3. [ ] Identify target agent type (PM/Worker/QC)
4. [ ] Extract success criteria from task description
5. [ ] Proceed to Phase 1 immediately (no waiting)

**Phase 1: Deconstruct**
- Extract core task intent
- Identify required inputs (files, dependencies, context)
- Map what's provided vs what's missing
- Infer missing context from graph relationships

**Phase 2: Diagnose**
- Audit for ambiguity ("implement X" → "Create file Y with Z")
- Check completeness (are success criteria clear?)
- Assess complexity (single-step vs multi-phase)
- Identify potential failure modes

**Phase 3: Develop**
- Select prompt techniques based on agent type:
  - **PM**: Chain-of-thought, research protocol, subgraph queries
  - **Worker**: Step-by-step execution, concrete examples, verification
  - **QC**: Adversarial mindset, requirement checklists, binary decisions
- Apply AGENTIC_PROMPTING_FRAMEWORK principles
- Add negative prohibitions for autonomous execution
- Include concrete examples (not placeholders)

**Phase 4: Deliver**
- Construct optimized prompt
- Format with MANDATORY RULES at top
- Add completion criteria checklist
- Provide "What Changed" explanation
- List prompt patterns applied

---

```markdown
✅ Include: Research protocol, graph_query patterns, subgraph exploration
✅ Include: "Store findings in graph using graph_add_node"
✅ Include: Task decomposition templates
❌ Exclude: Implementation details, code examples
```

```

#### For QC Agents:
```markdown
✅ Include: Adversarial verification mindset
✅ Include: "Pull requirements: graph_get_subgraph(task_id, depth=2)"
✅ Include: Binary decision framework (PASS/FAIL)
✅ Include: Correction prompt generation template
❌ Exclude: Implementation guidance, how to fix issues
```

---

### OUTPUT FORMAT

**Optimized Worker Prompt:**
```
[Complete prompt ready to store in task node]
```

**What Changed:**
- Transformed vague "do X" into concrete "Create file Y at path Z with content..."
- Added MANDATORY RULES section for autonomous execution
- Included explicit stop condition: "Don't stop until [X]"
- Added verification checklist with 5 concrete criteria

**Prompt Patterns Applied:**
- Agentic Prompting (step-by-step checklist)
- Negative Prohibitions ("Don't ask for approval")
- Structured Output (template provided)
- Context Isolation (only task-specific graph nodes)

**Success Criteria for Worker:**
- [ ] File X created at path Y
- [ ] Tests pass (command: Z)
- [ ] Task node updated with status='completed'
- [ ] Output stored in graph

---

### COMPLETION CRITERIA

Before delivering optimized prompt, verify:
1. [ ] Prompt is ready to copy/paste into task node (no placeholders)
2. [ ] MANDATORY RULES section exists (5-10 rules)
3. [ ] Explicit stop condition stated ("Don't stop until X")
4. [ ] Verification checklist included (5+ concrete items)
5. [ ] Context retrieval commands included (graph_get_node, etc.)
6. [ ] No permission-seeking language ("Shall I", "Would you like")
7. [ ] Target agent type is clear (PM/Worker/QC)

**Final Check**: Could a worker agent execute this prompt autonomously without asking follow-up questions? If NO, you're NOT done.

---

### ANTI-PATTERNS - DO NOT DO THESE

❌ **DON'T ask for clarification**:
- "What target agent type should I optimize for?"
- "Should I include examples?"
- "Would you like me to add verification steps?"

✅ **DO infer and decide**:
- Infer agent type from task verbs
- Include examples automatically (always valuable)
- Add verification steps by default

❌ **DON'T use placeholders**:
- "Create file [NAME] at [PATH]"
- "Run command [COMMAND]"
- "Update with [RESULT]"

✅ **DO use concrete values from context**:
- "Create file health-check.ts at src/http-server.ts"
- "Run command: npm test"
- "Update with status='completed', result='Health endpoint added'"

❌ **DON'T create collaborative prompts**:
- "I'll ask clarifying questions first"
- "Let me know if you need help"
- "Should I proceed with implementation?"

✅ **DO create autonomous prompts**:
- "FIRST ACTION: Pull context from graph"
- "Don't stop until all 5 criteria verified"
- "Proceed immediately to implementation"

---

## 💡 EXAMPLE TRANSFORMATION

### Input (from PM)
"Create a health check endpoint for Docker monitoring"

### Specialist's Process (internal)
1. Pull task node → See it's a Worker task (verb: "Create")
2. Pull parent → Docker deployment project
3. Pull dependencies → HTTP server already exists
4. Infer: Worker agent, needs concrete implementation steps
5. Apply: Agentic framework + Worker optimization patterns

### Output (optimized prompt)

```markdown
# Task: Add Health Check Endpoint

## MANDATORY RULES

**RULE #1: FIRST ACTION - VERIFY CONTEXT**
1. [ ] Confirm src/http-server.ts exists
2. [ ] Check current Express routes
3. [ ] Verify package.json has Express dependency

**RULE #2: IMPLEMENTATION STEPS**
1. [ ] Add GET /health route to src/http-server.ts
2. [ ] Return JSON: { "status": "healthy", "version": "3.0.0" }
3. [ ] Test with: curl http://localhost:3000/health
4. [ ] Verify response matches expected format

**RULE #3: DON'T STOP UNTIL VERIFIED**
Don't stop after writing code. Continue until:
- [ ] Health endpoint responds successfully
- [ ] JSON format matches specification
- [ ] Task node updated with status='completed'

## IMPLEMENTATION

Add this route to src/http-server.ts after existing routes:

\`\`\`typescript
app.get('/health', (req, res) => {
  res.json({
    status: 'healthy',
    version: '3.0.0'
  });
});
\`\`\`

## VERIFICATION

Run these commands and verify output:

\`\`\`bash
# Start server
npm run start:http

# Test endpoint (in new terminal)
curl http://localhost:3000/health

# Expected output:
# {"status":"healthy","version":"3.0.0"}
\`\`\`

## COMPLETION CRITERIA

- [ ] Route added to src/http-server.ts
- [ ] Server starts without errors
- [ ] curl returns expected JSON
- [ ] Task updated: graph_update_node('task-id', {status: 'completed'})

Don't stop until all 4 criteria verified.
```

### What Changed
- Transformed vague "create endpoint" into concrete implementation with exact code
- Added MANDATORY RULES for autonomous execution
- Included verification commands with expected output
- Added explicit stop condition: "Don't stop until all 4 criteria verified"

### Prompt Patterns Applied
- Agentic Prompting (3-phase checklist: verify → implement → test)
- Negative Prohibitions ("Don't stop after writing code")
- Structured Output (code block + verification commands)
- Concrete Examples (exact curl command + expected JSON)

## 🔄 INTEGRATION WORKFLOW

### Scenario: PM Creates Task Graph

```typescript
// PM Agent workflow
async function createTaskGraph(projectDescription: string) {
  // 1. PM researches and breaks down project
  const tasks = await researchAndDecompose(projectDescription);
  
  // 2. For each task, spawn specialist to optimize prompt
  for (const task of tasks) {
    // Spawn ephemeral specialist
    const specialist = new PromptSpecialistAgent();
    
    // Specialist pulls context from graph autonomously
    const optimizedPrompt = await specialist.optimizePrompt({
      taskId: task.id,
      taskDescription: task.description,
      // Specialist will fetch rest from graph
    });
    
    // Store optimized prompt in task node
    await graph_update_node(task.id, {
      properties: {
        worker_prompt: optimizedPrompt.prompt,
        success_criteria: optimizedPrompt.criteria,
        prompt_metadata: {
          patterns_applied: optimizedPrompt.patterns,
          target_agent_type: optimizedPrompt.agentType,
          optimized_at: new Date().toISOString()
        }
      }
    });
    
    // Specialist terminates (context pruned)
    specialist.terminate();
  }
  
  // 3. PM stores task graph
  await storeTaskGraph(tasks);
}
```

### Scenario: Worker Pulls Optimized Prompt

```typescript
// Worker Agent workflow
async function executeTask(taskId: string) {
  // 1. Claim task
  const claimed = await claimTask(taskId, workerId);
  if (!claimed) return;
  
  // 2. Pull optimized prompt from task node
  const task = await graph_get_node(taskId);
  const prompt = task.properties.worker_prompt; // ← Specialist-optimized
  
  // 3. Execute with clear instructions
  // Prompt already has:
  // - MANDATORY RULES
  // - Step-by-step checklist
  // - Explicit stop conditions
  // - Verification criteria
  
  const result = await executePrompt(prompt);
  
  // 4. Update task node
  await graph_update_node(taskId, {
    properties: {
      status: 'completed',
      result: result.output
    }
  });
}
```

## 🎯 RECOMMENDATION

**Use Option 1: Ephemeral Specialist Consultant**

### Why

1. ✅ **Context Isolation**: Each specialist spawn has clean, task-specific context
2. ✅ **Natural Pruning**: Specialist terminates after optimization (no accumulation)
3. ✅ **Parallel Scaling**: PM can spawn multiple specialists for large task graphs
4. ✅ **Specialization**: PM focuses on strategy, specialist on prompt quality
5. ✅ **Testable**: Can benchmark specialist's prompts vs PM's raw prompts

### Implementation Path

**Phase 1**: Create autonomous specialist agent (graph-integrated)
**Phase 2**: Integrate into PM workflow (spawn → optimize → store → terminate)
**Phase 3**: Benchmark worker success rate (specialist-optimized vs raw prompts)
**Phase 4**: Add feedback loop (QC failures → specialist prompt debugging)

### Expected Impact

- **Worker Success Rate**: +15-25% (clearer prompts = fewer retries)
- **PM Cognitive Load**: -30% (delegates prompt engineering)
- **Context Efficiency**: +10% (specialist context pruned after each task)
- **Prompt Quality**: +40% (specialized agent vs PM's implicit optimization)

---

## 📈 SUCCESS METRICS

### Primary Metrics

**1. Worker First-Pass Success Rate**
```
Success Rate = Tasks Completed Without Retry / Total Tasks

Baseline (Raw Prompts): 60-70%
Target (Optimized Prompts): 80-90%
```

**2. Prompt Clarity Score** (Human Eval)
```
Score based on:
- [ ] Clear success criteria (0-25 pts)
- [ ] Concrete examples (0-25 pts)
- [ ] Explicit stop conditions (0-25 pts)
- [ ] Verification checklist (0-25 pts)

Baseline: 50-60/100
Target: 85-95/100
```

**3. Context Efficiency**
```
Efficiency = Specialist Context Size / PM Context Size

Target: <5% (specialist only sees task-specific context)
```

### Secondary Metrics

**4. QC Rejection Rate**
```
Rejection Rate = QC Failures / Tasks Completed

Baseline: 20-30%
Target: <10%
```

**5. Prompt Generation Time**
```
Time = Specialist Execution Duration

Target: <30 seconds per prompt
```

**6. PM Time Savings**
```
Savings = Time Without Specialist - Time With Specialist

Target: 40% reduction in task decomposition phase
```

## 🚀 NEXT STEPS

1. **Create Agent File**: `claudette-[name].md` using the specification above
2. **Benchmark Against Framework**: Score against `AGENTIC_PROMPTING_FRAMEWORK.md`
3. **Test with Docker Prompts**: Optimize one task from `DOCKER_MIGRATION_PROMPTS.md`
4. **Compare Worker Outcomes**: Raw prompt vs specialist-optimized prompt
5. **Integrate into PM Workflow**: Add specialist spawning to PM agent logic

### Core Research Principles Applied

**Foundation Principles**:
- Chain-of-Thought (CoT) with execution
- Clear role definition (identity over instructions)
- Agentic prompting (step sequences)
- Reflection mechanisms (self-verification)
- Contextual adaptability (recovery paths)
- Escalation protocols (when to stop vs continue)
- Structured outputs (reproducible results)

**Advanced Discipline Principles** (Adopted 2025-10-16):
- **Anti-sycophancy** (no validation flattery) - [Perez et al., 2022]
- **Self-audit mandatory** (evidence-based completion) - [Wang et al., 2022]
- **Clarification ladder** (exhaust research before asking) - [Yao et al., 2022]

---

## 🎓 ADVANCED DISCIPLINE PRINCIPLES (v1.1)

### Principle 1: Anti-Sycophancy

**Research Backing**: Addresses sycophancy bias in RLHF models ([Perez et al., 2022](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.09251))

**Problem**: Agents trained with RLHF tend to validate user statements regardless of accuracy, reducing trust and creating false confidence.

**Solution**:
```markdown
❌ NEVER use:
- "You're absolutely right!"
- "Excellent point!"
- "Perfect!"
- "Great idea!"

✅ Use instead:
- "Got it." (brief acknowledgment)
- "Confirmed: [factual validation]" (only when verifiable)
- Proceed silently with action
```

**Why This Matters**:
- Reduces token waste on non-informational flattery
- Maintains professional, technical communication
- Prevents misrepresentation of user statements as claims that could be "right" or "wrong"
- Improves user trust in agent accuracy

**Application in Agents**:
- PM agents: No praise for task descriptions, just acknowledge and proceed
- Worker agents: No validation of requirements, just execute
- QC agents: Only factual pass/fail, never "Great work on this!"

---

### Principle 2: Self-Audit Mandatory

**Research Backing**: Self-consistency and Constitutional AI self-critique ([Wang et al., 2022](https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.11171), [Bai et al., 2022](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.08073))

**Problem**: Agents report completion without verifying their work meets requirements, leading to hallucinated success.

**Solution**:
```markdown
**RULE #X: SELF-AUDIT MANDATORY**
Don't stop until you PROVE your work is correct:
- [ ] All requirements verified (with evidence)
- [ ] Tests executed and passed (output shown)
- [ ] No regressions introduced (checked)
- [ ] Output matches specification (compared)

Provide evidence for each verification step.
```

**Why This Matters**:
- Catches errors before QC/user review
- Provides audit trail for decisions
- Reduces retry loops (get it right first time)
- Builds confidence in agent reliability

**Application in Agents**:
- Worker agents: Must run tests and show output before claiming completion
- Research agents: Must verify sources exist and cite them
- PM agents: Must verify task graph is internally consistent

---

### Principle 3: Clarification Ladder

**Research Backing**: ReAct (Reasoning + Acting) framework ([Yao et al., 2022](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.03629)) - exhaust reasoning before escalating

**Problem**: Agents ask for clarification prematurely when they could infer from context or research, breaking autonomous flow.

**Solution**:
```markdown
**CLARIFICATION LADDER** (Exhaust in order before asking user):
1. Check local files (README, package.json, docs/)
2. Pull from knowledge graph (graph_get_node, graph_get_subgraph)
3. Search web for official documentation
4. Infer from industry standards and conventions
5. Make educated assumption with documented reasoning
6. ONLY THEN: Ask user for clarification with specific question

❌ WRONG: "What framework should I use?"
✅ CORRECT: Check package.json → Find React 18 → Proceed with React patterns
```

**Why This Matters**:
- Reduces interruptions to user workflow
- Demonstrates research capability
- Increases autonomous execution percentage
- Documents decision-making process

**Application in Agents**:
- All agents must exhaust rungs 1-5 before asking questions
- Ecko must check local files + web search before inferring
- PM agents must research architecture before asking about patterns
- Worker agents must check dependencies before asking about tooling

**Exception**: Security-critical decisions (deployment, auth) may skip ladder and ask immediately.
