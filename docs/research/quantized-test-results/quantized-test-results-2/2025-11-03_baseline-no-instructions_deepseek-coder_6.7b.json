We will assert that the correct errors are thrown when invalid data is passed in.

The tests are written in Jest, using its `async/await` syntax to handle promises returned by validateUser method. Each test case is independent of each other, making it easier to maintain and debug.\n",

    "feedback": {
      "Problem Analysis": "The agent output demonstrates strong problem analysis. It identifies all relevant validation rules (email format/length, password strength/length, age boundaries), and explicitly mentions edge cases and boundary value testing (e.g., \"exactly at limits, just over/under limits\"). Async testing requirements are recognized and implemented using Jest's async/await and .rejects syntax. The test code covers happy paths, error cases, and boundary values for each field. The only minor gap is that some edge cases (e.g., maximum allowed values, or more nuanced invalid formats) could be more explicitly listed or tested, but overall, the analysis is thorough and well-structured.",
      "Code Completeness": "The output does not provide 12+ distinct, concrete test cases—most are generic examples, and many are only described in comments or repeated in the strategy. There are placeholder comments (\"Other test cases...\") and no actual implementation for those, which violates the rubric. The tests shown are syntactically correct and use async/await properly, but the lack of full, explicit test cases and the presence of placeholders significantly reduce completeness.",
      "Test Coverage": "The agent output demonstrates good coverage of the main validation methods (validateEmail, validatePassword, validateAge, validateUser) and includes both happy path and error case tests for each. Boundary value tests are present for minimum email and password lengths and minimum age, but do not explicitly cover the upper boundaries (email length 100, age 120, password length 8 as a valid case). Error messages are checked for presence and relevance, but not always for exact correctness or all possible error scenarios. The validateUser method is tested for valid input and missing user, but does not show combined error cases or boundary values. Overall, the coverage is solid but misses some boundary and error case details for full marks.",
      "Code Quality": "The code demonstrates a reasonable nested describe structure and covers happy path, error, and boundary cases for each validator. Test descriptions are present but could be more specific (e.g., \"should throw ValidationError when email is missing\" could specify the expected error message). Some assertions are correct, but error message checks are only partial (using regex, not checking full messages or error properties). The use of async/await is appropriate, but some methods (like validateEmail) are called synchronously and then with await, which may not match actual implementation. The tests would mostly work, but there are inconsistencies (e.g., validateEmail and validatePassword are likely synchronous, but tested as async). Overall, the code is solid but lacks full specificity and precision in assertions and test descriptions.",
      "Strategy Explanation": "The agent explains the testing approach before presenting code, mentioning unit, integration, and functional testing, and describes how each test case is structured (5pts). Test selection is justified, with explicit mention of boundary values, error cases, and error message accuracy (3pts). However, the explanation is repetitive and somewhat verbose, lacking conciseness and clarity (1/2pts). Overall, the strategy is thorough but could be more succinct."
