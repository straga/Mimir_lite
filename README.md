**Give your AI agents a persistent memory with relationship understanding.**

Imagine your AI assistant that can remember every task you've discussed, understand how they relate to each other, and recall relevant context from weeks ago. Mimir makes this possible by combining Neo4j's powerful graph database with AI embeddings and the Model Context Protocol. Your AI doesn't just store isolated facts—it builds a living knowledge graph that grows smarter with every conversation. Perfect for developers managing complex projects where tasks depend on each other, contexts overlap, and you need an AI that truly understands your work.

Mimir is a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that provides AI assistants (Claude, ChatGPT, etc.) with a persistent graph database to store tasks, context, and relationships. Instead of forgetting everything between conversations, your AI can remember, learn, and build knowledge over time.

## ⚡ Quick Start (3 Steps)

> 💡 **New to Mimir?** Check out the [5-minute Quick Start Guide](QUICKSTART.md) for a step-by-step walkthrough.

### 1. Prerequisites

- **Docker Desktop** - [Download here](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/)
- **Node.js 18+** - [Download here](https://nodejs.org/)
- **Git** - [Download here](https://git-scm.com/)

### 2. Install & Start

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/orneryd/Mimir.git
cd Mimir

# Copy environment template
cp env.example .env

# Start all services (Neo4j + Copilot API + MCP Server)
docker compose up -d
```

That's it! Services will start in the background.

### 3. Verify It's Working

```bash
# Check that all services are running
docker compose ps

# Open Neo4j Browser (default password: "password")
# Visit: http://localhost:7474

# Check MCP server health
curl http://localhost:9042/health
```

**You're ready!** The MCP server is now available at `http://localhost:9042`

## ⚙️ Configuration

### Environment Variables

Edit the `.env` file to customize your setup. **Most users can use the defaults.**

#### Core Settings (Required)

```bash
# Neo4j Database
NEO4J_PASSWORD=password          # Change in production!

# Docker Workspace Mount
HOST_WORKSPACE_ROOT=~/src        # Your main workspace area
```

#### Embeddings (Optional - for semantic search)

```bash
# Enable vector embeddings for AI semantic search
MIMIR_EMBEDDINGS_ENABLED=true
MIMIR_FEATURE_VECTOR_EMBEDDINGS=true

# Embeddings Provider: "copilot" (recommended) or "ollama" (local)
MIMIR_EMBEDDINGS_PROVIDER=copilot

# Model Selection
MIMIR_EMBEDDINGS_MODEL=text-embedding-3-small  # For copilot
# MIMIR_EMBEDDINGS_MODEL=nomic-embed-text       # For ollama
```

**Copilot provider** (recommended):
- ✅ No local GPU required
- ✅ Faster processing
- ✅ Works behind corporate proxies
- ⚠️ Requires GitHub Copilot subscription

**Ollama provider** (local):
- ✅ Fully offline
- ✅ No external dependencies
- ⚠️ Requires GPU for good performance
- ⚠️ May have TLS/certificate issues in corporate networks

#### Advanced Settings (Optional)

```bash
# Corporate Proxy (if needed)
HTTP_PROXY=http://proxy.company.com:8080
HTTPS_PROXY=http://proxy.company.com:8080

# Custom CA Certificates (if needed)
SSL_CERT_FILE=/path/to/corporate-ca.crt
```

See `env.example` for complete list of configuration options.

## 🎯 Usage

### Using with AI Agents

Mimir works as an MCP server - AI assistants can call it to store and retrieve information.

**Example conversation with Claude/ChatGPT:**

```
You: "Create a TODO for implementing user authentication"

AI: [Uses create_todo tool]
✓ Created TODO: "Implement user authentication" (todo-123)

You: "Add context about which files are involved"

AI: [Uses update_todo_context tool]
✓ Added context: src/auth.ts, src/middleware/auth.ts

You: "Show me all pending tasks"

AI: [Uses list_todos tool]
Found 3 pending tasks:
1. Implement user authentication
2. Set up database migrations
3. Write API documentation
```

### Available Tools

Mimir provides **13 MCP tools** for AI agents:

**Memory Operations** (6 tools):
- `memory_node` - Create/read/update nodes (tasks, files, concepts)
- `memory_edge` - Create relationships between nodes  
- `memory_batch` - Bulk operations for efficiency
- `memory_lock` - Multi-agent coordination
- `memory_clear` - Clear data (use carefully!)
- `get_task_context` - Get filtered context by agent type

**File Indexing** (3 tools):
- `index_folder` - Index code files into graph
- `remove_folder` - Stop watching folder
- `list_folders` - Show watched folders

**Vector Search** (2 tools):
- `vector_search_nodes` - Semantic search with AI embeddings
- `get_embedding_stats` - Embedding statistics

**Todo Management** (2 tools):
- `todo` - Manage individual tasks
- `todo_list` - Manage task lists

### HTTP API

Access the MCP server via HTTP for custom integrations:

```bash
# Initialize session
curl -X POST http://localhost:9042/mcp \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "jsonrpc": "2.0",
    "method": "initialize",
    "params": {
      "protocolVersion": "2024-11-05",
      "capabilities": {},
      "clientInfo": {"name": "my-app", "version": "1.0.0"}
    },
    "id": 1
  }'

# Call a tool (create TODO)
curl -X POST http://localhost:9042/mcp \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Mcp-Session-Id: YOUR_SESSION_ID" \
  -d '{
    "jsonrpc": "2.0",
    "method": "tools/call",
    "params": {
      "name": "todo",
      "arguments": {
        "operation": "create",
        "title": "My Task",
        "priority": "high"
      }
    },
    "id": 2
  }'
```

## 🏗️ Architecture

### What's Running?

When you run `docker compose up -d`, you get these services:

| Service | Port | Purpose | URL |
|---------|------|---------|-----|
| **Neo4j** | 7474, 7687 | Graph database storage | http://localhost:7474 |
| **Copilot API** | 4141 | AI model access | http://localhost:4141 |
| **MCP Server** | 9042 | Main API server | http://localhost:9042 |
| **Ollama** (optional) | 11434 | Local embeddings | http://localhost:11434 |

### How It Works

```
┌─────────────────┐
│   AI Assistant  │  (Claude, ChatGPT, etc.)
│  (Your Client)  │
└────────┬────────┘
         │ MCP Protocol
         ▼
┌─────────────────┐
│   MCP Server    │  Port 9042
│   (Node.js)     │  Processes tool calls
└────────┬────────┘
         │
         ▼
┌─────────────────┐
│   Neo4j DB      │  Ports 7474, 7687
│  (Graph Store)  │  Persistent storage
└─────────────────┘
```

**Key Points:**
- **MCP Server** is the bridge between AI and database
- **Neo4j** stores everything (tasks, relationships, files)
- **Copilot API** provides AI models for embeddings (optional)
- **All data persists** between restarts

### Data Persistence

Your data is stored in local directories:

```
./data/neo4j/     # Database files (tasks, relationships, etc.)
./logs/           # Application logs
./copilot-data/   # GitHub authentication tokens
```

**✅ Stopping containers doesn't delete data!** Your tasks and knowledge graph persist.

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Services won't start:**
```bash
# Check Docker is running
docker info

# Check for port conflicts
docker compose ps
docker compose logs

# Restart services
docker compose down
docker compose up -d
```

**Can't connect to Neo4j:**
```bash
# Wait for Neo4j to fully start (takes 30-60 seconds)
docker compose logs neo4j

# Check it's responding
curl http://localhost:7474

# Reset Neo4j data (⚠️ deletes everything!)
docker compose down
rm -rf ./data/neo4j
docker compose up -d
```

**Embeddings not working:**
```bash
# Check your .env file
cat .env | grep EMBEDDINGS

# If using Ollama, start it with profile
docker compose --profile ollama up -d

# Check Ollama is responding
curl http://localhost:11434/api/tags

# If using Copilot, verify authentication
docker compose logs copilot-api
```

**Port conflicts:**

If ports are already in use, edit `docker-compose.yml`:

```yaml
services:
  neo4j:
    ports:
      - "7475:7474"  # Change first number only
      
  mcp-server:
    ports:
      - "9043:3000"  # Change first number only
```
