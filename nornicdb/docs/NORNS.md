# The Norns: NornicDB's Namesake

NornicDB takes its name from the **Norns** — the Norse deities who weave the threads of fate at the base of Yggdrasil, the world tree.

## The Three Norns

In Norse mythology, three female beings control the destiny of gods and mortals alike:

| Norn | Domain | Meaning |
|------|--------|---------|
| **Urðr** | Past | "That which has become" |
| **Verðandi** | Present | "That which is happening" |
| **Skuld** | Future | "That which shall be" |

Together, they weave the threads of fate (*wyrd*) that determine the course of all existence.

## Connection to NornicDB

The Norns' role as weavers of destiny mirrors NornicDB's core functionality:

### Weaving Connections
Just as the Norns weave threads to connect all beings, NornicDB automatically discovers and creates relationships between data nodes based on:
- Embedding similarity
- Co-access patterns  
- Temporal proximity
- Transitive inference

### Three Tiers of Memory
NornicDB's memory decay system reflects the Norns' domains:

| Memory Tier | Norn Parallel | Half-Life |
|-------------|---------------|-----------|
| **Episodic** | Skuld (Future-focused, fleeting) | 7 days |
| **Semantic** | Verðandi (Present knowledge) | 69 days |
| **Procedural** | Urðr (Accumulated wisdom) | 693 days |

### Destiny Emerges from Connections
The Norns don't create events directly — they weave the threads that connect them. Similarly, NornicDB doesn't define your data's meaning — it reveals the relationships that give it significance.

## The Logo

The NornicDB logo represents three interwoven threads meeting at a central nexus point, symbolizing:
- The three Norns working in concert
- Data relationships converging to reveal meaning
- Past, present, and future unified in the knowledge graph

The gold accents represent moments of destiny — the points where threads cross and connections form.
