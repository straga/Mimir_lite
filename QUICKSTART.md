# Mimir Quick Start Guide

Get Mimir running in 10 minutes with step-by-step instructions.

## Prerequisites

Before starting, install these tools:

- **Docker Desktop** (with 16GB RAM allocated) → https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/
- **Node.js 18+** → https://nodejs.org/
- **Git** → https://git-scm.com/
- **GitHub Copilot Subscription** (Individual, Business, or Enterprise)

> 💡 **Docker Memory**: Mimir requires Docker Desktop with **at least 16GB RAM** allocated. Check: Docker Desktop → Settings → Resources → Memory

---

## Step 1: Clone Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/orneryd/Mimir.git
cd Mimir
```

---

## Step 2: Configure Environment

```bash
# Copy the example environment file
cp env.example .env

# (Optional) Edit .env to customize settings
# Default Neo4j password is "password" - change for production!
# Default workspace path is ~/src - change if needed
```

**Key settings in `.env`:**
```bash
NEO4J_PASSWORD=password          # Change in production!
HOST_WORKSPACE_ROOT=~/src        # Your code workspace
```

---

## Step 3: Build Docker Images

```bash
# Build the MCP server Docker image
npm run build:docker
```

This command:
- Builds the TypeScript MCP server
- Creates a Docker image with all dependencies
- Takes 2-5 minutes on first run

---

## Step 4: Start All Services

```bash
# Start Neo4j, Copilot API, and Mimir Server (with Web UI)
docker compose up
```

> ⚠️ **Important**: Do NOT use `-d` (detached mode) on first run. You need to see the logs for authentication.

You'll see logs from multiple services starting up. **This is normal:**
- `neo4j_db` - Database initialization
- `copilot_api_server` - GitHub authentication
- `mimir-server` - MCP server + Web UI startup

> 💡 **Note**: Open-WebUI is optional and disabled by default. To enable it, uncomment the `open-webui` service in `docker-compose.yml`.

---

## Step 5: Authenticate with GitHub Copilot

### If Already Logged In

If you see this message, you're good to go:
```
copilot_api_server  | ✔ Logged in as <your-github-username>
copilot_api_server  | ℹ Available models:
copilot_api_server  | - gpt-4.1
copilot_api_server  | - gpt-4o
copilot_api_server  | - o1-preview
```

**Skip to Step 6!**

### If NOT Logged In

You'll see this message (possibly intermixed with Neo4j logs):

```
copilot_api_server  | ℹ Not logged in, getting new access token
copilot_api_server  | ℹ Please enter the code "HD56-PAQW" in https://github.com/login/device
```

**Follow these steps QUICKLY (you have ~5 minutes):**

1. **Copy the 8-digit code** (e.g., `HD56-PAQW`)
2. **Open the URL** in your browser: https://github.com/login/device
3. **Paste the code** and authorize GitHub Copilot
4. **Wait for confirmation** in the terminal:
   ```
   copilot_api_server  | ✔ Logged in as <your-github-username>
   ```

> 💡 **Tip**: The logs might be intermixed with Neo4j startup messages. Look for lines starting with `copilot_api_server`.

> ⏱️ **Timing**: If you authenticate fast enough (within 1-2 minutes), the health checks will pass automatically. If you're too slow, you may need to restart: `docker compose restart copilot-api`

---

## Step 6: Verify Services Are Running

Once all services are healthy, you should see:

```
copilot_api_server  | ✔ Logged in as <username>
copilot_api_server  | ℹ Available models: ...
mcp_server          | MCP server listening on port 3000
neo4j_db            | Started.
```

**Check service status:**
```bash
# In a new terminal (keep docker compose up running)
docker compose ps
```

You should see all services as `healthy`:
```
NAME                  STATUS
neo4j_db              Up (healthy)
copilot_api_server    Up (healthy)
mimir-server          Up (healthy)
```

**Test the endpoints:**
```bash
# Mimir Web UI (Portal + File Indexing)
open http://localhost:9042

# Neo4j Browser (should open in browser)
open http://localhost:7474
# Username: neo4j, Password: password

# Mimir API Health Check
curl http://localhost:9042/health
# Should return: {"status":"ok"}

# Copilot API Models
curl http://localhost:4141/v1/models
# Should return JSON with available models
```

---

## Step 7: Access Mimir Web UI

The Mimir Web UI provides a portal with file indexing and access to all features:

```
http://localhost:9042
```

**What's Available:**
1. **Portal (Main Hub)** - Navigation and file indexing management
2. **File Indexing** - Add/remove folders to index your codebase
3. **Orchestration Studio** - Visual workflow builder (coming soon)
4. **MCP API** - Available at `/mcp` endpoint for AI assistants
5. **Chat API** - Available at `/api/chat` for conversational interfaces

**Try these features:**
- Add a folder to index your codebase
- View indexed files in Neo4j Browser
- Call MCP tools via the API

### (Optional) Enable Open-WebUI

If you want a ChatGPT-like interface:

1. Edit `docker-compose.yml` and uncomment the `open-webui` service
2. Restart: `docker compose up -d`
3. Access at http://localhost:3000
4. Create an admin account (first user becomes admin)
5. Select model: **gpt-4.1** (default, avoids premium usage)

---

## Step 8: (Optional) Run in Background

Once authenticated and verified, you can run in detached mode:

```bash
# Stop the current run (Ctrl+C)
docker compose down

# Start in background
docker compose up -d

# View logs anytime
docker compose logs -f
```

---

## Troubleshooting

### Problem: Copilot API won't authenticate

**Symptoms:**
```
copilot_api_server  | ℹ Not logged in, getting new access token
copilot_api_server  | ℹ Please enter the code "XXXX-XXXX" in https://github.com/login/device
```

**Solution:**
1. Make sure you have a GitHub Copilot subscription
2. Open https://github.com/login/device in your browser
3. Enter the code QUICKLY (within 5 minutes)
4. If you miss the window, restart: `docker compose restart copilot-api`

### Problem: Can't find the authentication code in logs

**Symptoms:** Logs are too busy, can't see the code

**Solution:**
```bash
# Filter logs to see only copilot-api messages
docker compose logs copilot-api | grep "Please enter"
```

### Problem: Services won't start

**Symptoms:** `docker compose ps` shows services as `unhealthy`

**Solution:**
```bash
# Check what's wrong
docker compose logs

# Common fixes:
# 1. Docker memory too low (need 16GB)
# 2. Ports already in use (7474, 4141, 9042, 3000)
# 3. Neo4j taking too long to start (wait 60 seconds)

# Nuclear option: clean restart
docker compose down -v  # WARNING: Deletes all data!
docker compose up
```

### Problem: Neo4j Browser won't open

**Symptoms:** http://localhost:7474 doesn't load

**Solution:**
```bash
# Wait longer (Neo4j takes 30-60 seconds to start)
docker compose logs neo4j

# Check if it's running
docker compose ps neo4j

# If unhealthy, check memory allocation
# Docker Desktop → Settings → Resources → Memory (need 16GB)
```

### Problem: Port conflicts

**Symptoms:**
```
Error: bind: address already in use
```

**Solution:**
Edit `docker-compose.yml` and change the **first** port number:
```yaml
ports:
  - "7475:7474"  # Change 7474 → 7475 (or any free port)
```

### Problem: MCP server can't connect to Neo4j

**Symptoms:**
```
mcp_server  | Error: Failed to connect to Neo4j
```

**Solution:**
```bash
# Make sure Neo4j is healthy first
docker compose ps neo4j

# Check Neo4j password matches .env
docker compose logs neo4j | grep password

# Restart Mimir server after Neo4j is ready
docker compose restart mimir-server
```

### 3. Enable Mimir Pipelines in Open-WebUI

After starting Open-WebUI, enable the pre-packaged Mimir pipelines:

1. Go to http://localhost:3000
2. Click your username (bottom-left) → **"Admin Panel"**
3. Navigate to **"Pipelines"** tab
4. Toggle each Mimir pipeline to enable it:
   - ✅ **Mimir Orchestrator** - Full PM → Worker → QC workflow
   - ✅ **Mimir RAG Auto** - Chat with semantic search
   - ✅ **Mimir File Browser** - Browse indexed files
   - ✅ **Mimir Tools Wrapper** - Command shortcuts (`/list_folders`, `/search`)

**See**: [PIPELINE_CONFIGURATION.md](docs/guides/PIPELINE_CONFIGURATION.md) for detailed instructions and LLM provider switching.

### 4. Explore the Web Interface

Open-WebUI at http://localhost:3000 provides:
- ChatGPT-like interface
- Mimir pipeline integration (after enabling)
- File browser actions
- Model selection
- Chat history

### 5. Index Your Codebase

Enable file indexing to let AI agents search your code:

```bash
# Inside the mimir-server container
docker exec -it mimir_server node /app/scripts/setup-watch.js /workspace

# Or from Open-WebUI, use the file browser pipeline
```

## Token Persistence

Your GitHub token is saved in `./copilot-data/` and persists across restarts. You only need to authenticate once unless you:
- Delete the `copilot-data` directory
- Run `docker compose down -v` (removes volumes)
- Revoke the token on GitHub
